# zramroot

zramroot is a collection of initramfs scripts for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems that allows your Linux system to operate entirely from RAM. This project is inspired by ramroot for Arch Linux but is designed specifically for initramfs-based Debian and Ubuntu systems.

By loading the root filesystem into compressed RAM during boot, zramroot allows your system to run without requiring the original storage device after boot completion.

## How It Works

zramroot integrates with your system's initramfs to:

1. **Detect the zramroot cmdline kernel parameter** during boot
2. **Mount your physical root partition** read-write for logging and filesystem copying
3. **Calculate optimal ZRAM size** based on your configuration and available RAM
4. **Create and configure a ZRAM device** using your chosen compression algorithm
5. **Format the ZRAM device** with your selected filesystem
6. **Copy your entire root filesystem** from physical storage to ZRAM
7. **Adjust system configurations** in the ZRAM root to prevent mounting original partitions
8. **Switch root** to the ZRAM device and continue booting

This project is currently not finished, you might encounter bugs and end up with a unbootable installation. I would recommend backing up your system before trying to install zramroot. The scripts should work however i have not tested it yet on several different types of system configurations. 

## Installation

### Using the Install Script (Recommended)

1. Download the zramroot files and enter the directory
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neol00/zramroot.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd zramroot
   ```
3. Make the install script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
4. Run the script with sudo:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to complete installation
6. Reboot and select the zramroot entry in your GRUB menu

The install script will:
- Check for required files
- Ask for additional kernel modules to include and load with the scripts during early boot (if needed)
- Install all components to the appropriate locations
- Create a backup of files it replaces
- Add a new GRUB boot entry with the option to load to zram

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

1. Copy the files to their respective locations:
   ```bash
   sudo cp zramroot-boot /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/zramroot-boot
   sudo cp local /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local
   sudo cp zramroot /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/zramroot
   sudo cp zramroot-config /usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf.d/zramroot-config
   sudo cp zramroot-config /etc/zramroot.conf
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/zramroot-boot
   sudo chmod +x /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local
   sudo chmod +x /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/zramroot
   ```

3. Edit your GRUB configuration to add a zramroot entry:
   - Create or edit `/etc/grub.d/40_custom` with an entry similar to:
   ```
   menuentry 'Linux (Load Root to ZRAM)' {
     search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root YOUR_ROOT_UUID
     linux /boot/vmlinuz root=UUID=YOUR_ROOT_UUID rw zramroot
     initrd /boot/initrd.img
   }
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_ROOT_UUID` with your actual root partition UUID (find it with `blkid`)

4. Update GRUB and rebuild initramfs:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   sudo update-initramfs -c -k all
   ```

## Configuration

zramroot can be configured by editing `/etc/zramroot.conf`. After making changes, update your initramfs with:
```bash
sudo update-initramfs -c -k all
```

### Configuration Options

#### Debugging
```
DEBUG_MODE="no"
```
Set to "yes" for verbose logging to `/var/log/zramroot-*.log` on the physical hard-drive root partition. All debug logs are exclusively written to the physical storage device, never to the zram device, ensuring logs persist even if zramroot encounters issues.

#### ZRAM Device Settings
```
ZRAM_SIZE_MiB=0
ZRAM_ALGO="zstd"
ZRAM_FS_TYPE="ext4"
ZRAM_MOUNT_OPTS="rw,noatime"
```
- `ZRAM_SIZE_MiB`: Manual ZRAM size in MiB (0 for automatic calculation)
- `ZRAM_ALGO`: Compression algorithm (options: zstd, lz4, lzo)
- `ZRAM_FS_TYPE`: Filesystem for ZRAM (options: ext4, btrfs, xfs)
- `ZRAM_MOUNT_OPTS`: Mount options for the ZRAM filesystem

#### RAM Management Settings
```
RAM_MIN_FREE_MiB=512
RAM_PREF_FREE_MiB=512
ZRAM_MIN_FREE_MiB=256
ZRAM_MAX_FREE_MiB=35840
```
- `RAM_MIN_FREE_MiB`: Minimum physical RAM to keep free (MiB)
- `RAM_PREF_FREE_MiB`: Preferred physical RAM to keep free (MiB)
- `ZRAM_MIN_FREE_MiB`: Minimum free space to keep in ZRAM (MiB)
- `ZRAM_MAX_FREE_MiB`: Maximum free space to allocate in ZRAM (MiB)

#### Resource Calculation
```
ESTIMATED_COMPRESSION_RATIO=2.5
ZRAM_BUFFER_PERCENT=10
```
- `ESTIMATED_COMPRESSION_RATIO`: Expected compression ratio
- `ZRAM_BUFFER_PERCENT`: Buffer percentage to add to root size

#### Advanced Settings
```
ZRAM_DEVICE_NUM=0
TRIGGER_PARAMETER="zramroot"
WAIT_TIMEOUT=30
```
- `ZRAM_DEVICE_NUM`: ZRAM device number to use
- `TRIGGER_PARAMETER`: Kernel parameter to activate zramroot
- `WAIT_TIMEOUT`: Seconds to wait for root device to appear

## Debugging

zramroot includes comprehensive logging to help troubleshoot issues:

1. **Enable Debug Mode**: Edit `/etc/zramroot.conf` and set `DEBUG_MODE="yes"`, then rebuild initramfs.

2. **Check Log Files**:
   - All logs are written to the physical root partition at `/var/log/zramroot-*.log`
   - Early boot logs are also written to the kernel message buffer (view with `dmesg | grep zramroot`)
   
3. **How Logging Works**:
   - The boot script mounts the physical root partition read-write at `/mnt/real_root_rw`
   - All logs are written to `/mnt/real_root_rw/var/log/zramroot-*.log` (never to the zram device)
   - This ensures logs persist even if there are problems with the zram setup
   - Log files include timestamps and a unique boot ID for tracking

3. **Common Issues**:

   - **System fails to boot with zramroot**:
     - Boot with the normal GRUB entry (without zramroot)
     - Check logs in `/var/log/zramroot-*.log`
     - Verify your configuration settings

   - **Not enough RAM**:
     - If the system has insufficient RAM, zramroot will log this in the error logs
     - Try adjusting `RAM_MIN_FREE_MiB` and `ZRAM_MIN_FREE_MiB` to lower values

   - **ZRAM module issues**:
     - Verify the ZRAM module is available: `modinfo zram`
     - If using custom compression, ensure the compression module is available

   - **Filesystem tools missing**:
     - Ensure filesystem tools for your chosen `ZRAM_FS_TYPE` are installed
     - For ext4: `e2fsprogs`
     - For btrfs: `btrfs-progs`
     - For xfs: `xfsprogs`

4. **Debugging Commands**:
   - View ZRAM status: `zramctl`
   - Check mountpoints: `findmnt | grep zram`
   - Verify RAM usage: `free -m`
   - View kernel logs: `dmesg | grep -i zramroot`
   - Check persistent logs: `ls -la /var/log/zramroot-*.log`
